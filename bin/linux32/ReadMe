The executable in this directory was built using g++ on an ubuntu distribution.
The executable bit probably needs to be changed after you unzip using this command:
  chmod +x WritelogInetServer
If it still won't run, then cd to the "source" directory in this tree and execute the "make" command.
It assumes the gnu c++ compiler is installed.
